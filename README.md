## 🔍 About Me

I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. With 3 years of experience at Cognizant in API-driven environments and current graduate studies in Business Analytics at Montclair State University (GPA: 4.0), I blend practical industry knowledge with a strong academic foundation.

### 🧠 I Specialize In:

- 📊 **Data Analytics & Visualization**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), KPI design, statistical modeling, and visual storytelling using Python and Tableau
- 📈 **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Regression modeling, feature engineering, and performance evaluation for forecasting and prediction tasks
- ⚙️ **Backend Architecture & Microservices**: Building RESTful APIs using Java (Spring Boot), applying service discovery, circuit breakers, and asynchronous messaging
- 🗄️ **Databases & Storage**: Experience with **MySQL** and **H2** for relational data modeling, persistence, and integration within microservices architecture 
- 🔄 **Resilience & Scalability**: Load balancing, Hystrix fault tolerance, Kafka-based decoupled communication, and configuration centralization via Spring Cloud
- 🧪 **Testing & Optimization**: API testing (Postman), performance tuning (JMeter), and writing efficient, maintainable code

## 🚀 Projects

#### 🧩 [Microservices-Based API Platform](https://github.com/lokeshlavu01/online-shopping)
Built a modular microservices application on a local machine using **Eclipse IDE**, designed to simulate real-world, service-oriented architecture with a focus on scalability, resilience, and configuration management.

- 🛠️ Developed RESTful APIs using **Java (Spring Boot)** with a clean, layered architecture
- 🗄️ Integrated with a **relational database (MySQL)** for persistent data storage in each service
- 🔄 Implemented **Eureka Service Discovery** for dynamic service registration and inter-service communication
- ⚙️ Used **Spring Cloud Config Server** for centralized configuration across services
- 🛡️ Integrated **Hystrix circuit breakers** to ensure fault tolerance and service stability under failure
- ⚖️ Applied **load balancing** using **Spring Cloud Gateway** to route requests evenly among services
- 📬 Incorporated **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous communication between microservices
- 🧪 Tested all services and endpoints using **Postman**

#### 🚲 [Capital Bikeshare Data Analysis](https://github.com/lokeshlavu01/Capital-Bikeshare-Data-Analysis)
Performed an end-to-end exploratory and predictive data analysis project on **16 million+ ride records** to uncover behavioral trends, forecast demand, and support data-driven decision-making.

- 📊 Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**
- 🧼 Cleaned and preprocessed over 16M records to handle missing values, data types, and outliers
- 📈 Built a **regression model (R² = 0.69)** to forecast ride volume based on factors like hour, day, and weather
- 🧠 Engineered features from timestamps (hour, weekday, season) to analyze demand cycles
- 🔍 Identified **peak usage patterns**, **user type behavior**, and **weather impact** on ridership
- 📅 Visualized trends in **daily**, **hourly**, and **monthly** ride volumes
- 📈 Created interactive **Tableau dashboards** (in a separate workbook) to support visual storytelling
- 🧾 Designed and tracked **key KPIs**:  
  - Total Rides  
  - Peak Hour  
  - Average Trip Duration
  - Top Demanding Station
- 🧪 Executed all analysis in **Jupyter Notebook** and presented visual summaries both in Python and Tableau
- 💡 Gained hands-on experience in real-world data storytelling, statistical modeling, and insight communication
